# 🔥 Fire Detection (Main Project) & 🚗 License Plate Detection (Mini Project)

Undergraduate projects focused on **Computer Vision** using **Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Tesseract OCR**.  
Both projects were created as part of my undergraduate coursework — starting with a mini project on license plate detection and later extended to a main project on fire detection, which was **published in IRJET (Volume 9, Issue 4, 2022)**.

## 🔥 Fire Detection — Main Project (IRJET Published)

### 📘 Overview
- A real-time computer vision system to detect fire and trigger alerts.
- Published in the *International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET)*.
- Uses webcam video feed to identify potential fire regions based on color, shape, and motion.

### 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Pygame (for sound alerts)

### ⚙️ Key Features
- Captures live video using a webcam.  
- Analyzes frames in RGB, HSV, YCrCb, and Lab color spaces.  
- Uses morphological operations and thresholding to identify fire pixels.  
- Plays an alarm sound automatically when fire is detected.  
- Detects non-fire frames to reduce false alerts.  
- Includes full report, abstract, presentation, and IRJET publication.

### 📂 Folder Details
- **fire_detection/Code/** → contains `Fire detection.py` (main code)  
- **fire_detection/Presentation/** → includes project slides  
- **fire_detection/Publication/** → includes IRJET paper (V9I4332.pdf)  
- **fire_detection/report/** → includes full report and documentation

## 🚗 License Plate Detection — Mini Project

### 📘 Overview
- Initial mini project developed before the fire detection project.  
- Detects and recognizes license plates from vehicle images using classical ML and OCR.  
- Served as a base for understanding object localization and text recognition.

### 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- OpenCV  
- Tesseract OCR

### ⚙️ Key Features
- Detects vehicle license plates using contour detection.  
- Performs character segmentation and text extraction using OCR.  
- Preprocesses images with grayscale conversion, thresholding, and noise removal.  
- Includes report, abstract, and presentation.

### 📂 Folder Details
- **license_plate_detection/Abstract/** → project abstract (final ABSTRACT.docx)  
- **license_plate_detection/Presentation/** → slides (License plate.pptx)  
- **license_plate_detection/report/** → main project report (REAL TIME LICENSE PLATE DETECTION USING TENSORFLOW AND TESSERACT.docx)

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Integrate fire detection with IoT for automatic notifications (SMS or email).  
- Implement Raspberry Pi support for edge-level real-time detection.  
- Improve OCR accuracy under low light or blurred conditions.  
- Expand to multilingual license plates and dynamic datasets.
